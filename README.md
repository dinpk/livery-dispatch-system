I have re-written a simplified version of a Java Swing desktop application as a PHP web application, which I could not finish a decade ago. I was developing this application all alone for a company based in Northern Virginia (USA) while I was living there at the time. The application got bigger and complicated for me then, so the project got abandoned eventually. Last year I got a chance to revisit the application and decided to redo it in my “favorite” language, thinking it might benefit smaller companies with not too complicated operations.
