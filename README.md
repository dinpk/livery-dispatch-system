This is a simplified version of a Java Swing desktop application developed as a PHP web application, which I could not finish a decade ago. I was developing this Java application for a company based in Northern Virginia while I was living there at the time. The project got abandoned eventually. Last year (2021) I got a chance to look at the database used in that project and decided to redo the application it in my “favorite” language, thinking it might benefit smaller companies with not too complicated operations. A lot of code was copied over from my previous PHP projects  which will be optimized eventually.
