I'm writing a simplified version of a Java Swing desktop application as a PHP web application, which I could not finish a decade ago because the application got bigger and complicated for me. I was developing this application for a company based in Northern Virginia while I was living there at that time. The project got abandoned eventually. Last year I got a chance to revisit the application and decided to redo it in my “favorite” language, thinking it might benefit smaller companies with not too complicated operations.
